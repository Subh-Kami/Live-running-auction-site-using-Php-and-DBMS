# Live-running-auction-site-using-Php-and-DBMS
I created this software as an project from a college student from Canada. It was my first time indulging into such a big project since I had to get it done within a week's deadline.

What does this software do?

-This is an auction website where sellers setup items for sales and the buyers bid for the items. This goes on till the closing time of the bidding, thus seeling it to the highest bidder within that period.

-The highest bidder will be sent an email regarding the ending off the bidding contest for the respective item, announcing them as the winner whereas giving them a link to the Paypal to perform the payments for the item.

-For the testing, I used paypal sandbox accounts to create a real time environment and give a nice demonstration of how everything would work out.

This is an basic overview of what the entire system is about, although I omitted most of the details, its for you check out. Go to my repository and check out the project files to get a better understanding of the Auction website.

System used: A private server provided by the respective college
             PhpmyAdmin Database System
             PhpStorm for coding
             Filezilla for the transfer of the data from my PC to the private server

Thank you ;)
